		<p class="boldClass"> I <strong>love</strong> to <i>code</i> and <b>create</b>. <br>
		I started coding long time ago.<br>
		I am learning how to code with new tools for the next  12 weeks.<br>
		<br>
		Before joinning DevCodeCamp, I was a Manufacturing Engineer.<br>
		After 4 years I desided to go back to <i>Software Engineering</i> <br>
		<br> 
		Below are some of the Languages I used to use all the time for my job.<br>
		But it has been a while since I used them and there is a whole new way to program<br> so I have to go back to school.
